Hi everyone! I'm Davide Laffi, a very determined Software Engineer. I'm working as Frontend Engineer in Techedge, a consultant tech company since November 2021.
I have achieved a master degree in computer science and engineering in Politecnico di Milano graduating in first session available. Before I have completed
my bachelor formation in Computer science and engineering in Bologna's Alma mater university.

I love coding and creating personal projects in my free time and I see computer science as a powerful tool to express and realize innovating and surprising ideas
