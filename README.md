Hi everyone! I'm Davide Laffi, a very determined **Software Engineer**. I'm working as **Frontend Engineer** in Techedge, a consultant tech company since November 2021.
I have achieved a **master degree in computer science and engineering in Politecnico di Milano** graduating in first session available. Before I have completed
my bachelor formation in Computer science and engineering in Bologna's Alma mater university.

I love coding and creating personal projects in my free time and I see computer science as a powerful tool to **express and realize innovating and surprising ideas**.

My best skills are determination and problem solving which I have enriched during my studies in engineer and my first working experience. I'm always looking for new
challenges to face and solve with the best attention to details and delivery.
